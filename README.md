[AMPL](https://ampl.com) is the most powerful and intuitive tool for developing and deploying
complex optimization solutions in business & scientific applications.
AMPL connects to most open-source and commercial solvers and allows you to switch easily between them.

AMPL has APIs for several popular programming languages
(e.g., [Python](https://amplpy.readthedocs.io/), [R](https://rampl.readthedocs.io/), etc.)
and it allows you to only model once in AMPL and interact with it using an API for a language 
you are familiar with.
